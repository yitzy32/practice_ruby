#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 20.
#     For example, [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3] becomes [2, 18, 12, 3].

# numbers = [4, 1, 6, 8, 9, 89]

# numbers.select! { |number| number < 20 }
# p numbers

#  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that start with the letter "w".
#     For example, ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"] becomes ["winner", "winner"].

# words = ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"]
# words.select! { |word| word.start_with? "w" }
# p words

#  3. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices greater than 5 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}].

# items = [{ name: "chair", price: 100 }, { name: "pencil", price: 1 }, { name: "book", price: 4 }]
# items.select! { |item| item[:price] > 5 }
# p items

#  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the even numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [2, 4, 8].

# numbers = [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7]
# numbers.select! { |number| number.even? }
# p numbers

#  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings shorter than 4 letters.
#     For example, ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"] becomes ["a", "man", "a", "a"].

# strings = ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"]

# strings.select! { |str| str.length < 4 }
# p strings

#  6. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with names shorter than 6 letters (from the :name key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "book", price: 4}].

# items = [{ name: "chair", price: 100 }, { name: "pencil", price: 1 }, { name: "book", price: 4 }]

# items.select! { |item| item[:name].length < 6 }
# p items

#  7. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 10.
#     For example, [8, 23, 0, 44, 1980, 3] becomes [8, 0, 3].

# numbers = [8, 23, 0, 44, 1980, 3]

# numbers.select! { |number| number < 10 }
# p numbers

#  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that don't start with the letter "b".
#     For example, ["big", "little", "good", "bad"] becomes ["little", "good"].

# strings = ["big", "little", "good", "bad"]
# strings.select! { |string| string[0] != "b" }
# p strings

#  9. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices less than 10 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}].

# items = [{ name: "chair", price: 100 }, { name: "pencil", price: 1 }, { name: "book", price: 4 }]
# cheap_items = items.select { |item| item[:price] < 10 }
# p cheap_items

# 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the odd numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [5, 1, 9, 7].

# numbers = [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7]
# odd_numbers = numbers.select { |number| number.odd? }
# p odd_numbers
