# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

# p "Please enter your first name"
# first_name = gets.chomp
# p "Please enter your last name"
# last_name = gets.chomp
# p first_name + " " + last_name

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# p "Please enter your first name"
# first_name = gets.chomp
# p "Please enter your last name"
# last_name = gets.chomp

# p "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# p "Please enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   p "polo"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

# color1 = "blue"
# color2 = "green"
# color3 = "purple"

# p "On a beautiful day, with a" + " " + color1 + " " + "sky, and" + " " + color2 + " " + "grass,some" + " " + color3 + " " + "hippos rested outside"

# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# color1 = "blue"
# color2 = "green"
# color3 = "purple"

# p "On a beautiful day, with a #{color1} sky, #{color2} grass, some #{color3} hippos rested in the grass"

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."

# p "Please enter your name"
# input = gets.chomp
# if input != "santa"
#   p "You're not Santa"
# end

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# title1 = "The very hungry caterpillar"
# author1 = "Eric Carl"
# title2 = "The Cat in the Hat"
# author2 = "Dr. Seuss"

# p "we read" + " " + title1 + " " + "by" + " " + author1 + " " + "and" + " " + title2 + " " + "by" + " " + author2 + "."

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# title1 = "The very hungry caterpillar"
# author1 = "Eric Carl"
# title2 = "The Cat in the Hat"
# author2 = "Dr. Seuss"

# p "We read #{title1} by #{author1} and #{title2} by #{author2}"

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# p "Please enter a password"
# input = gets.chomp
# if input == "Joshua"
#   p "Shall we play a game?"
# else
#   p "Access denied"
# end

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# city1 = "NY"
# city2 = "NJ"
# city3 = "CA"

# p "first we went to" + " " + city1 + " " + "then to" + " " + city2 + " " + "then to" + " " + city3 + "."
